# Rochester City Art
A website that's created to point out local art and murals in Rochester, NY. 


# How to Contribute
There is no easy method to do that ...yet... but I'm working on a way to add new locations and upload images directly to the website. The full idea is to allow people want to add photos to have the opportunity to do so. 

# Licenses
Since this is an open project, I hope to make as many things open and accessible as possible. The photos used for the site are taken by me and are under the [CC-BY-SA-4.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc-by-sa-4.0/) license.

# API Docs
The documentation for the API is available on [api.roccity.art](http://api.roccity.art)

### Still to do

- [X] Build a REST API for the locations and image data
- [ ] Build a toggleable Gallery View
- [ ] Build method for others to contribute locations and photos
