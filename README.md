# Rochester City Art
A website that's created to point out local art and murals in Rochester, NY. 


# How to Contribute
There is no easy method to do that... yet but I'm working on a way to add new locations and upload images directly to the website. Currently its a hand made list of murals that gets updated via git commits. For now, please send any suggestions (Name, Physical Location, and photo) to james@jspann.me and only include photos that you took yourself.

# Licenses
Since this is a community project, I hope to make as many things open and accessible as possible. The photos used for the site (in the "photos" folder) are taken by me and are under the [CC-BY-SA-4.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc-by-sa-4.0/) license.

### Still to do

- [ ] Build a REST API for the locations and image data
- [ ] Build a toggleable Gallery View
- [ ] Build method for others to contribute locations and photos
